### Alex Gochenour's Portfolio Site

I figured it might fun to learn some new technologies, so I decided on Supabase for both authentication and PostgreSQL tables. But Amazon Cognito's authentication is way better so I went back to that but then added Supabase for blog image storage.

### Technology list:

- Supabase
- Redux Toolkit
- Tanstack Query
- AWS Cognito
- Jest
- And a lot of timeless CSS!

### How to view localhost on mobile:

- Click the WiFi symbol in the upper right corner of Mac OS desktop.
- Click "Wi-Fi Settings..."
- Find the current connected Wi-Fi network and click "Details..."
- The value next to "IP address" is what you want. Type that into the mobile browser, then add :3000

## Reference: 

- New GitHub access token? No problem! Here's the incantation to run if not prompted by git:

```
git remote set-url origin https://USERNAME:TOKEN@github.com/USERNAME/REPO.git
```
