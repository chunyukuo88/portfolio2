### Alex Gochenour's Portfolio Site

I made myself a little portfolio in rather short order, so kindly forgive the lack of TDD.

I figured it might fun to learn some new technologies, so I decided on Supabase for both authentication and PostgreSQL tables. 

Fun fact: I am a crossword addict and enjoy making 5x5 mini crosswords, so stick around for a while and play one of my original minis! You can navigate to it from the main menu.

### Technology list:

- Supabase
- Redux Toolkit
- `react-spring`
- Jest
- And a lot of timeless CSS!
