### Alex Gochenour's Portfolio Site

I figured it might fun to learn some new technologies, so I decided on Supabase for both authentication and PostgreSQL tables. But Amazon Cognito's authentication is way better so I went back to that but then added Supabase for blog image storage.

### Technology list:

- Supabase
- Redux Toolkit
- Tanstack Query
- AWS Cognito
- `react-spring`
- Jest
- And a lot of timeless CSS!
